## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- [] Search for weather information by entering a location in the search bar
- [] View current weather conditions including temperature, weather icon, and location details
- [] See additional weather metrics like "feels like" temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed, and precipitation amounts
- [] Browse a 7-day weather forecast with daily high/low temperatures and weather icons
- [] View an hourly forecast showing temperature changes throughout the day
- [] Switch between different days of the week using the day selector in the hourly forecast section
- [] Toggle between Imperial and Metric measurement units via the units dropdown
- [] Switch between specific temperature units (Celsius and Fahrenheit) and measurement units for wind speed (km/h and mph) and precipitation (millimeters) via the units dropdown
- [] View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- [] See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

I used chatgpt to help me break down my approach into steps to get started! 

- [] **Hour 0-1:** Set up project folder, HTML skeleton, CSS skeleton (layout only, no styling polish).

  - [X] Create styles folder with: desktop styles, mobile styles (link in html)
  - [X] Change commas in typeface filenames to hyphens to avoid unexpected behaviors
  - [X] Create scripts folder with: just main.js for now (link in html)
  - [X] Create utils folder with css variables (link in css)
  - [ ] Create HTML structure
  - [ ] Determine where media queries are necessary or if grid and flex are sufficient to develop the layout responsively
  - [ ] Create mobile CSS skeleton
- [] **Hour 1-2:** Work on mobile layout: search bar, current weather section, forecast cards stacking.
- [] **Hour 2-3:** Desktop layout: grid for forecast cards, sidebar/main differences. Add flex for cards.
- [] **Hour 3-4:** Start JS: fetch data for a hard-coded location, display in current weather section.
- [] **Hour 4-5:** Hook up search functionality: user input, API call, update UI.
- [] **Hour 5-6:** Add unit toggle (metric/imperial) logic and link it to UI conversion.
- [] **Evening wrap-up:** test responsiveness, try a different location, fix layout quirks.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('🎉')
}
```
